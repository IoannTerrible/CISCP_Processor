# CISC Processor Simulator 🚀

Welcome to the CISC Processor Simulator repository! This project provides a simulation of a Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) processor using C#.

## Overview ℹ️

The CISC Processor Simulator includes:

- Implementation of CISC instructions.
- A CISCProcessor class that emulates the functionality of a CISC processor.
- Console application to demonstrate the processor's functionality.


## How to Use 🛠️

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the `CISCProcessorDemo` project.
4. View the output in the Debug window to see the execution results and flags.

## Example Output 🖥️

After running the program, you will see output similar to:

Program execution started
Executing instruction: LoadImmediateInstruction
Execution result: Accumulator = 10
Flags after instruction: Zero = False, Carry = False
Executing instruction: AddWithCarryInstruction
Execution result: Accumulator = 15
Flags after instruction: Zero = False, Carry = False
Execution results:
Accumulator: 42
Zero Flag: False
Carry Flag: True
